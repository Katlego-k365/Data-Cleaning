# Zomato Dataset Data Cleaning Project

Project Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing the Zomato restaurant dataset for analysis. The raw dataset contained inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues that could affect insights and analysis. The goal was to create a clean, structured dataset suitable for further exploratory data analysis (EDA) or machine learning tasks.

# Dataset
- Source: Zomato Restaurant Dataset
- Contents: Includes information such as restaurant names, cuisines, ratings, locations, average cost for two, and other relevant features.

# Objective
- Identify and handle missing values.
- Remove duplicates and irrelevant columns.
- Standardize categorical data and correct inconsistent entries.
- Prepare the dataset for analysis or visualization tasks.

# Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

# Key Steps
1. **Data Loading**: Import the dataset using Pandas.  
2. **Data Inspection**: Check the structure, missing values, and anomalies in the dataset.  
3. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Handle missing values appropriately.
   - Remove duplicate rows.
   - Standardize column names and categorical data.
   - Correct inconsistent entries (e.g., spelling mistakes, wrong formats).  
# 4. **Data Transformation**:
   - Convert data types where necessary.
   - Normalize or standardize specific features if needed.  
# 5. **Export Cleaned Dataset**: Save the cleaned dataset to a new CSV file for further analysis.
